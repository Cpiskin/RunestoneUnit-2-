# RunestoneUnit-2- notes

2.1 Objects: Instances of Classes - Objects are like things created from blueprints in programming, representing data and behavior.

2.2 Creating and Storing Objects (Instantiation) - Instantiation is the process of making an object from a class, and it can be kept in a variable for later.

2.3 Calling a Void Method - Void methods are functions that do stuff but don't give back anything, and you call them with dots.

2.4 Calling a Void Method with Parameters - Void methods with parameters are functions that take in inputs, do stuff, and don't give back anything, helping to organize code.

2.5 Calling a Non-void Method - Non-void methods give back a value after doing stuff, and you call them kinda like void methods.

2.6 String Objects: Concatenation, Literals & More - String objects deal with text in programming, like joining text and using direct written text.

2.7 String Methods - String methods do various things to text, like finding lengths, changing cases, and searching for pieces of text.

2.8 Wrapper Classes: Integers and Doubles - Wrapper classes let basic data types act like objects, giving extra abilities and working with object-based programming ideas.

2.9 Using the Math Class - The Math class in Java offers a bunch of ways to do math stuff, like figuring out square roots, making random numbers, and so on.
